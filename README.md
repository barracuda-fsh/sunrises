# sunrises
Daily sunrise and sunset indicator and wallpaper changer (at sunset and sunrise) for Windows10.

You will need the file GeoLite2-City.mmdb for it to work. It's too big of a file to upload it on github... about 60MB. You can download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6yZEqR-2bPz3NHZTbPVcUr22Q1mY9GL/view?usp=sharing
Don't forget to unzip it.

Windows defender reports the .exe as a virus, but it is not. It's built from the code you see here.

I will post more instructions soon.
